<strong>Depends:</strong>

R(>=3.2.2)

Rcpp, RcppArmadillo

## General overview

The identification of biological modulators of gene regulation from gene expression data is one of the most important tasks in molecular biology to understand and control cellular response to external stimuli in gene regulation. The state-of-the-art solutions to this problem, including MINDy (Wang and others, 2009), GEM (Babur and others, 2010), MIMOSA (Hansen and others, 2010), MONSTER (Everett and others, 2011), and CINDy (Giorgi and others, 2014), have been developed for this task. However, these methods cannot deal with capturing complex gene regulation when multiple transcription factors and modulators are functionally related. We have developed a more general class of the identification of modulators in the framework of enegy statistics and a specific implementation called GIMLET.
